## Seed Data
All recipe content (names, ingredients, quantities, instructions, and dietary tags) in `src/data/seedData.js` was generated by an AI assistant (Google Gemini) as representative sample data specifically written for this project. The 15 recipes are based on commonly known dishes and were not copied from any external source.
